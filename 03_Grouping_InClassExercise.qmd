## Democratic Votes for Impeachment (First)

Load the data

```{r}
# run this to load the data 
# it will create a dataframe called "impeach," with all House Democrats and election results/demographics
# it indicates whether or not the member publicly called for the impeachment 
# note: THIS IS FOR THE FIRST TRUMP IMPEACHMENT IN 2020, NOT THE SECOND IN 2021

impeach <- read_csv("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRh8d5JaDqBtByzNw2JZF3idaACobDhhk-p7chJoktA0HawELHFOvjQOqCpzGA4MGONvPlR7GASqW-K/pub?gid=1765341510&single=true&output=csv")

Questions - Write your code using grouping in the chunks below to help answer the following questions.

```{r}
# 1) How many members in the dataset who are holdouts on impeachment (NO in for_impeachment) vs. supporters (YES)?

impeach %>% 
  group_by(for_impeachment) %>% 
  summarize(n())

```


```{r}
# 2) Answer this question using grouping.
# Similar to #1 above, now break down the members of Congress by TWO measures:
       # - those who are for or against impeachment
       # - districts above/below national GDP

impeach %>% 
  group_by(for_impeachment) %>% 
  summarize(n())

```


```{r}
# 3) Now do the same as #2, but this time instead of GDP look at above/below 
# the national avg percent of college graduates (pct_bachelors_compared_to_national)









```


```{r}
# 4) Instead of showing the above/below national average counts for those for or 
# against impeachment, this time show the combined MEAN percentage of college
# grads (pct_bachelors) for districts that are Yes for impeachment vs. No








```


```{r}
# 5) Do the same as #4, but this time show the combined MEAN percentage of 
# the vote that Donald Trump received for districts that are Yes for 
# impeachment vs. No









```


```{r}
# 6) Filter out only the members who are a yes for impeachment, 
# then of those how many won their 2018 election by less than
# 5 percentage points (margin_flag_2018) vs. more?
  
  







```
